# Discord_Ollama_Bot
This advanced Discord bot connects directly to a local Ollama AI server and uses any installed AI model for intelligent, natural language responses. Itâ€™s designed to reply in a human-like way and always addresses users by their Discord name, making conversations feel personal and realistic. Ideal for communities that want a smart, interactive assistant without relying on cloud-based AI services.


# Final Touches:
1: Install dependencies if you haven't yet:
`sudo apt install python3`
`pip install discord.py aiohttp`


2: Replace `"YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"` with your actual bot token.

3: Replace `Ollama Model With Install Model`

4: Make sure your Ollama instance is running locally with a capable model (llama3, mistral, deepseek, etc.).

5: Run the bot:
`python3 discord-ollama-bot.py`
